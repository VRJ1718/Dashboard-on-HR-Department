Unveiling My HR Analytics Dashboard! 📊
I recently built an HR Analytics Dashboard to analyze employee attrition trends and uncover key workforce insights. Using Tableau, I transformed raw HR data into actionable visualizations, helping organizations make data-driven decisions.
🔍 Key Insights from the Dashboard:
 ✅ Attrition Trends – 237 employees have left, while 1,233 remain.
 ✅ Department-Wise Analysis – R&D has the highest attrition (133 employees left), followed by Sales (92).
 ✅ Gender-Based Insights – More males (150) left compared to females (87).
 ✅ Impact of Work-Life Balance – Employees with poor work-life balance (rated 1) have the highest attrition.
 ✅ Experience-Based Trends – New employees (0-2 years) are most likely to leave, emphasizing the need for better onboarding and retention strategies.
💡 Why This Matters?
 Employee attrition can impact productivity, morale, and recruitment costs. By leveraging data analytics, HR teams can predict trends, identify risk factors, and implement proactive retention strategies.
📈 What’s Next?
 I’m excited to keep exploring workforce analytics and refining my skills in data visualization, predictive modeling, and business intelligence.
